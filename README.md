### Project Overview
This study focuses on understanding customer behavior through data analysis and segmentation. By combining RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) with K-Means clustering, I grouped customers into meaningful segments such as Loyal, Promising, and Lapsed.
These insights can help businesses tailor marketing campaigns, improve retention, and increase revenue.

### Objectives
- Identify different customer types based on their purchase patterns.
- Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing.
- Build a clear, interactive Power BI dashboard for visual storytelling.

---
### Approach
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- RFM Analysis
- K-Means Clustering
- Visualization in Power BI

---
### Key Insights
- Loyal customers contribute the highest revenue despite being a smaller group.
- Lapsed customers form a large portion but have low engagement, a potential reactivation opportunity.
- Seasonal peaks in sales suggest campaign opportunities.
