### Project Overview
This study focuses on understanding customer behavior through data analysis and segmentation. By combining RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) with K-Means clustering, I grouped customers into meaningful segments such as Loyal, Promising, and Lapsed.
These insights can help businesses tailor marketing campaigns, improve retention, and increase revenue.

Customer Segmentation Using EDA, RFM Analysis, and K-Means Clustering

- Objectives: The goal of the study is to identify different customer types based on their purchase patterns, provide actionable insights for targeted marketing, and build a clear, interactive Power BI dashboard for visual storytelling.
- Tools & Technologies: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, RFM modeling), Power BI (data modeling and dynamic dashboards), and Google Colab for analysis
  - **My Approach includes:**
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - RFM Analysis
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Visualization in Power BI
- **Key Insights:**
  - Loyal customers contribute the highest revenue despite being a smaller group.
  - Lapsed customers form a large portion but have low engagement, a potential reactivation opportunity.
  - Seasonal peaks in sales suggest campaign opportunities.
